## Features

### 🚀 Refresh Rate
- **Target Refresh Rate**: The target frame rate for XSOverlay rendering.
- **Contextual Performance**: Optionally apply Target Refresh Rate only when hovering over an overlay or while in Layout Mode.

### 🖱️ Cursor & Mouse
- **Always Hide**: Forcefully hides the system Windows Cursor in Desktop and Window Capture Overlay.
- **Always Update**: Reduces Windows Cursor latency by sending the position from the Pointer before the desktop frame is captured.
- **Mouse Smoothing**: Adjusts the level of smoothing applied to the Windows Cursor within Capture Overlay.
- **Physical Mouse Detector**: Relinquishes Pointer control when physical mouse movement is detected.
- **Windows Cursor Pointer**: Hides the Capture Overlay Cursor and uses the Windows Cursor image as the Pointer to mimic the SteamVR Dashboard.

### 👈 Pointer & Interaction
- **Active Click**: Clicking the inactive hand's Pointer makes it the Active Hand and performs a Mouse Click simultaneously for two-hand interaction.
- **Active WebViews**: Applies the inactive Pointer features to WebView Overlay such as Settings, Wrist, and others.
- **Double Click Delay**: Applies the Double Click Delay from XSOverlay settings to the physical Pointer itself, not just the cursor.
- **Emulate Mouse Click Animation**: Enables the Pointer click visual animation for Input Method > Emulate Mouse.
- **Inactive Highlight**: Highlights the inactive hand's Pointer in red for easier identification.
- **Inactive Opacity**: Sets the opacity level for the inactive hand's Pointer.
- **Scale Multiplier**: Multiplier for the Pointer scale relative to the global XSOverlay setting.


### 🎮 Mouse Navigation
- **Enable**: Custom keybindings for Mouse Forward/Back navigation.
- **Use Alt+Left/Right**: Use Alt+Left/Right keyboard shortcuts for navigation instead of Mouse Clicks. Targets the focused window instead of the hovered window.


### 🖥️ Dashboard Overlay
- **Persistent Visibility**: Allows Overlys to be displayed over the SteamVR Dashboard
  - Notifications, Pointer, Settings, Capture Windows, Wrist, and Keyboard.

### 📳 Haptic Feedback
- **Granular Feedback**: Individual various interactions:
  - Grabbing, Keyboard Hover/Press, Overlay Swapping, WebView interaction, and Pointer Locking.
- **Contextual Vibrations**: Haptic feedback for Sticky Keys and toggle Layout Mode.

### ⚡ Optimization
- **Efficiency Mode**: Enables Windows Efficiency Mode for XSOverlay to reduce CPU usage when not interacting with any Overlay.
- **Inactive Refresh Rate**: The target Refresh Rate for XSOverlay rendering when not interacting with any Overlay.
- **Optimization OSC**: Instead of connecting to OSC in the loop thread, connect to the OSC server when new data is sent.

### ✨ Quality of Life
- **Default Capture Overlay Texture**: Initializes a Capture Overlay with a white texture to prevent new spawns from appearing invisible.
- **Double Click Confirm**: Ensures that a Double Click is always sent reliably when using Emulate Mouse mode.
- **fpsVR Socket**: Attaches the fpsVR overlay to a specific socket position of XSOverlay.
- **Laser**: Draws a Laser Pointer from the VR controllers to mimic the SteamVR Dashboard for accurate targeting.
- **Overlay Curve Auto Refresh**: Automatically applies Overlay Curve changes to all active behaviors. For example, when the Overlay Curve setting changes, Overlay Scaling and Overlay Spawning are affected
- **Pin + Block Input Non Layout Mode**: Blocks interaction with 'Pinned' or 'Block Input' Overlay unless Layout Mode is active.
- **Pull Trigger Click Threshold**: The Trigger pull threshold required to trigger a Left Click.
- **Pull Trigger Pointer Lock**: Locks the Pointer in place while the Trigger is held for easier double clicking.
- **WebView Wider Scroll**: Makes the WebView scrollbar wider for easier interaction.
- **Windows Accent Color**: Using Windows accent color as XSOverlay accent color.
- **Wrist Over Position**: Increases the allowed positioning radius of the Wrist Overlay.

### 🔧 Fixes
- **Ctrl Key Sticky Fix**: Fixes the issue where the Ctrl key is not sticky.
- **Cursor Moving Interaction Fix**: Fix where Windows cursor movement events fail to interact with elements. For example, hovering the cursor over the Windows taskbar displays a thumbnail preview, or dragging to move the system tray icon.
- **Handle Scrolling Fix**: Normalize stick scrolling speed by the HMD refresh rate and support horizontal scrolling.
- **Keyboard Control Button State**: Fix keyboard control button color not following the state when summoning.
- **Load Layout Scale Fix**: Ensures saved scale values are applied correctly when loading an Overlay Layout.
- **Overlay Roll Curve Fix**: Prevents an Overlay from turning invisible when curvature and rotation change simultaneously.
- **WebView Fix**: Fixes an issue where certain WebView UI elements were not clickable.

### ✨ Community Request

- **Hide Invalid Battery**: Hide invalid battery device from Wrist Overlay.
- **Load Layout Keyboard**: Layout will save the current keyboard state to the selected profile.
- **Mouse Button Swap**: Detect the Windows setting 'Switch primary and secondary buttons' to auto-swap controller binding.

- **Overlay Confirm Close**: Requires pressing the close overlay button three times to close.
- **Window Toolbar Gesture**: When hovering over the Window Toolbar, right-click to switch to the previous Window or use thumbstick scrolling the Window list.
